title: "A systematic analysis of basin effects on surface ground motion"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we aim to show the incapability of Ground Motion Prediction Equations to appropriately incorporate local site effects. We propose a new set of required parameters that better represent the basin and are easy to obtain. We Finally show the capability of the proposed parameters by studying the case of 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake.'
