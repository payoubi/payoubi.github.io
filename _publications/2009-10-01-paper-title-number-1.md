In this paper, we aim to show the incapability of Ground Motion Prediction Equations to appropriately incorporate local site effects. We propose a new set of required parameters that better represent a basin and are easy to obtain. We Finally show the capability of the proposed approach by studying the case of 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake.
