Geotechnical design codes have been shifted from classical limit equilibrium analysis toward the performance-based procedures. In foundation design, settlement is the most representative parameter for its performance. Settlement of shallow foundations subjected to earthquake loading and its consequences is one of the most outstanding issues which should be considered in designing different structures. In this study, settlement of shallow footing on two-layered subsoil strata under earthquake loading is of concern. The numerical study presented in this research by means of a 3D dynamic fully coupled u-p analysis, addresses the effect of different parameters on shallow foundation settlement rested on two-layered soil. Results show that the presence of dense layer can mitigate the settlement up to 50% in comparison to uniform liquefiable layer. Putting the results of all the analyzes together, an equation was proposed in order to estimate shallow foundation settlement on two-layered subsoil.
