Seismic risk in Mexico City governed by site effects. The M8.1 1985 subduction zone
earthquake, which caused significant damage and loss of thousands of lives at 350km epicentral
distance, has become the quintessential example of the role that site effects can play in
modifying the amplitude, frequency and duration of ground shaking; and in aggravating the
catastrophic consequences of earthquakes. We here present observations and analyses of
the $M_w$ 7.1 September 19, 2017 event that --while triggered by an intraplate rupture at
approximately half the epicentral distance of the 1985 event relative to Mexico City-- caused
severe structural damage to a few tens of buildings located in a relatively narrow zone between
the hill and lake zones of the basin, known as the transition zone. We show that the Mw 7.1
mainshock exposed the vulnerabilities of the pre-1985 building code in the transition zone; but
more importantly highlighted the improvement of the 1987 building code revision in terms of
the performance of modern high rise buildings that suffered catastrophic consequences during
the 1985 Michoácan earthquake sequence. We next analyze several records collected at stations
in the basin over the past 20 years, and we highlight the importance of understanding the three dimensional heterogeneity of the basin sediments, the coupling between hydrological setting and site response and the evolution of their characteristics with time, and the energy interaction
between the deep basin edge and the shallow clay ‘energy trap’ that gives-- and will continue to
give rise to fascinating wave propagation phenomena. Results presented are the collective effort
of the GEER teams that were deployed to perform post-earthquake reconnaissance in the
affected regions of the epicentral area and in Mexico City.
