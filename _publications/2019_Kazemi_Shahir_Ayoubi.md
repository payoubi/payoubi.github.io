Assessment of bearing capacity of shallow foundations is an important task in engineering practice
especially when the foundation is located at the top of a liquefiable soil. In this paper, simple
analytical equations have been proposed for calculation of the bearing capacity of shallow
foundations on liquefiable soil. The equations have been developed for two cases, separated based
on the depth of liquefaction and width of foundation, each of which acting with different
mechanisms. In addition, analytical predictions are evaluated against field observations from 1964
Niigata, 1990 Luzon and 1999 Adapazari earthquakes. The method is also tested against numerical
simulations, and easy to use design charts and simple equations have been derived for use in
engineering practice. It is shown that the proposed approach is capable of estimating bearing
capacity of shallow foundation on liquefiable soil. The obtained results reveal that decreasing the
depth of liquefiable layer as well as increasing foundation width leads to higher bearing capacity of
foundations on liquefiable soil
