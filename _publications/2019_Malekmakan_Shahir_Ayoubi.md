Lateral spreading is a common earthquake-induced phenomenon that usually takes place during
the liquefaction of sand layers on a gently sloped ground. This has had catastrophic effects in
the past events such as the 1964 Niigata, Japan earthquake. In this study, a recently proposed
variable permeability function is employed in a fully-coupled dynamic numerical model using
two-surface plasticity constitutive law to simulate lateral spreading. The variable permeability
function is re-calibrated such that the numerical model is able to simulate lateral spreading in
a more realistic way compared to the experimental records. By means of six centrifuge
experiments for verification, it is shown that the current numerical toolbox is capable of
capturing the underlying physics of liquefaction-induced lateral spreading properly. Using the
calibrated model, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted and the results are used to
develop a practical correlation to estimate lateral displacement of a liquefied gently sloped
ground.
